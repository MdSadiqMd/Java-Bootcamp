     1)Abstraction--it will show essential information(hiding internal details)
                    eg:we use phone but no need to learn how it works internally
     2)encapsulation--the act of putting various components together
                    eg:laptop is an encapsule of internet,speaker,storage
     3)inheritance--the act of driving new things from existing things
                    eg:inventing touch phone from normal phone
     4)polymorphism--one entity in many forms
                     eg:phone can used as camera,caluclator,radio...
