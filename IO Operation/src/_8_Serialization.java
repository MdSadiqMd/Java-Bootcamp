For Writing and Reading the data we have Buffer writer and reader and Print Writer
But to store videos,Audios on to a file and making them persistent(storing permanently) we use Input Output Streams
In serialization our main objective is security we store byte code in RAM that makes and to retrieve in normal form we use Deserialization
The converted Bytes to transfer to a file we have FileOutput Stream
To make data into sequence of bytes we use object output Stream
To make the process more efficient and faster we have Buffer Output Stream and Buffer Input Stream
To Reconstruct back the data of bytes we use Object Input Stream and File Input Stream
