/*
--> AVL - Adelson Velskii and Lamdis
--> It is a Self - Balancing BST which balances when the Balance of the tree changes when Node is Added to the Tree
--> In BST when the tree is long One-Direction Tree then the Time Complexity for searching an Element in Tree will be O(n) from O(log n)
--> *** If (Height of left Sub - Tree) - (Height of Right Sub - Tree) = 0 (or) 1 it's a Balanced Tree
