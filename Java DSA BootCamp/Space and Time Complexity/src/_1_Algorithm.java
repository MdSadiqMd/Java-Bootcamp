/*
Algorithm is a sequence of writing code in finite number of steps in it's beat space and time complexity
Properties of algorithm:
--> Terminate after an amount of time
--> Produce at least one output
--> Independent of Programming language
--> Unambiguous (no confusion and deterministic outcome)
ex:while(true):
        print("Allah") --> This is not a valid algorithm as it will print infinite number of times
