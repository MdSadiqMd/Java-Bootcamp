/*
In java, we create a variable and store data in it
But to store huge data we will not create that many variables we just create an array
But using Array comes with some Disadvantages
1.Size is fixed (if we modify the size that many objects will add later
2.Can store only heterogeneous type of Data
3.Doesn't have any Inbuilt Methods (inbuilt Methods are in strings not in Arrays)
Now we have Collection Framework which have some Inbuilt Classes and Interfaces which are used as an API by the developers
In collection we can store either Homogeneous or Heterogeneous type of data
We store Data In form of Objects
